#This file contains:
1- Standard deviation calculations.
2- Mean calculations.
3- Activity labels/descriptions.

#The approach used to clean the data was as follows:

1- Consider only the std and mean features, and subset the dataset based on that.

2- Merge the dataset using rbind.

3- Assign the activity labels to the IDs in the data set.

4- Merge the dataset using cbind.

5- Creating a tidy dataset, which calculates the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
